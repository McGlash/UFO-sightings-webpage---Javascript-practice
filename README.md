# Filtering tables in html via d3.js

Deployed > https://mcglash.github.io/UFO-sightings-webpage---Javascript-practice/

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess....

I wrote code that will creates a table dynamically based on this [dataset](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). The code also allows users to filter the table data for specific values. 

## Task

* Created a  HTML web page 

* Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Used multiple `input` tags and write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
